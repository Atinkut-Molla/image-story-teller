# Multilingual Image Story Generator: An LLM Web Application 📖

A Streamlit-based web application that turns images into **multilingual stories** using Google's Gemini models.  
This project is part of the course *Intelligent Software Engineering* @ UCAS.

You can adapt or deploy this app as your own image–to–story demo.

## Features

- 📤 **Upload Images**: JPG, PNG, and WebP support (up to ~10 MB).
- 🧠 **AI Storytelling**: Uses a Gemini vision model (e.g., `gemini-flash-lates`) to generate narratives.
- 🌍 **Multilingual Output**: English, Amharic, and Chinese story modes.
- 🎨 **Polished UI**: Two-panel layout inspired by the Ollam LLaVA Storyteller mockup.
